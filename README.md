Getting and Cleaning data Project
=================================
This is a course project for the getting and cleaning data course.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  


## File in this repo
1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md
3. run_analysis.R


## Steps to reproduce this project
1. Download and unzip the sourse (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Open RStudio and change the parameter of the setwd function to the working directory/folder
3. Open the R script run_analysis.R and run it
4. Save the result in tidy_data.txt.
